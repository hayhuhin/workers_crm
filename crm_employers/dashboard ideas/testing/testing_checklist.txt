functions data usage: 
1.available_positions : no Args
    get all records > return as list

2.switch_records : current_graph_id,requested_position
    get the position field by the input id - "current_graph_id"
    calling the available_positions to get all records
    calling find_graph_by_id to get the record by position(iterating over all records)
    returns switching places the ids so it will switch places

3.compare_record : src_id,user_data,max_record_amount
    find_graph_by_id to get the dst graph 
    quering to get the records by id 
    calling remove_records by the record number
    checking the positions to compare and adding the new record

4.find_graphID_by_position : position
    iterating over all records of the user and returning the id of the specific position

5.edit_record : record_id,new_data(dict)
    editing the existing graph with the new data

6.add_record : new_record,set_position
    adding new data to the records 

7.user_exists :collection , user 
    checking if the user exists if not creating simple first data to the user database 


ideas to solve it:
instead calling multible times in the class for getting the data i can call it once and then re-use it later when the method called
meaning it will open a session in the db call the get_data method > save it as class variable and re-use it in each specific method 
have to crete methods that first of all checking if records existing in the db 


no need for validation in the mongodb internal functioning and only when the methods called as add,edit,delete,create functions.

first i have to validate the inputs at add,edit,create,delete functions
