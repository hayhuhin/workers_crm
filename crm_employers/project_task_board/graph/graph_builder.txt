how to build the graph?



each user can modify his dashboard presentation(data is not live - query the data once a day and saves the result)

saving queried data:
1.caching system is needed?
2.prevent the users from refreshing the query 


how the user is going to query the DB

1.each user will gain appropriate access to the db via their rank of the department(example: back office employers can acceess managers db) - the access is added inside a sql graph permission table
2.the user will have limited options to the queries (example:choose table-income/outcome >> **self.user >> choose date: 12/12/12 - 11/11/13) - handled by the sql graph permission table
3.the user will choose which graph presentation to use - handled by the graph representation class


program:
user input >> validates the input >> query the sql db for permission >>query the no sql db >> save the graph data >>formating the result to graph input >> saves graph input to html >> response output

django design pattern for this graph feature:

user input :post request 
>> ** user_input_to_query function **:sending the query to the db model 
>> db_result proccessed by ** graph_formatting function **
>> pass graph formating data into graph_to_html function 
>> return the result to the user frontend .

constraints:
1.input validation
2.query limiting
3.query modifying
4.user experience tested well

the proccess is continued in the graph_todolist.txt file.
