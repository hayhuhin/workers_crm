# API handling and operations

## permission

django handles the permission of accessing specific end points and this makes it easier to handle different 
employer permissions and showing different information.


## constraints

1.each endpoint must be logicly handled in such way that i can add permissions for specific end points and it will block the user that trying to access the endpoint

2.i need to develop a manager department that can add income and outcome records and create employers with specific persmissions but not admin permissions!!

3.handle database reletionships carefuly so i will not overwright my code over and over.

4.each database structure must be implemented in draw.io first

5.try to have constent end points 

6.no complex queries into the database

7.make the code structure be compatible to adding cache system later into the application
