create user handle for api:
    1.permissions handle with session auth and csrftoken included
    https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/03/02/best-practices-for-rest-api-design/


first tasks:
1.handle user token auth - added token creation
2.understand the cors-headers 
3.handle the django settings folder with the new api changes

api best practices
have versioning in the uri path
    api/v1/graph/1

implement pagination to handle large datasets efficiently
    api/v1/graph/?status=merged&sort=position

response format must be always a json even the errors

implement caching mechanism to improve api performance
    example: http caching headers like-cache-control

implement logging to capture relevant information for debugging and monitoring.

add rate limit per api request

large amount of tests 

create logging system that logs for each user what did he do and when 
    example: user1 deleted record at 01/01/01 12:12:12 utc+2 with the permission:staff.


security:
    user token-based auth.
        token refresh HANDLING
