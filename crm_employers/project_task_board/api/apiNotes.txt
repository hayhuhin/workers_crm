notes:
the request.auth propery of the user class can show me the users auth token he sended the request

each request it runs the request.user and request.auth if no class authenticates then it will return :
django.contrib.auth.models.AnonymousUser and request.auth to None

When an unauthenticated request is denied permission there are two different error codes that may be appropriate.
HTTP 403 Unauthorized
HTTP 401 Permission Denied
