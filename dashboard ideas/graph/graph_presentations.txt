how the graph page works behind the scenes

we have 2 states : one is the get method and second is the post method.

GET METHOD - the basic method that used when the user reaching the dashboard page.

get method behind the scenes:
    class structure:
        GraphCalculator - this class queries the sql by the user needs and returns a data in a structured way.
        MongoDBConstructor - this class connects to the mongodb server and have CRUD methods .
        GraphRepresantation - this class getting x and y and returning a graph representation
        as html.

    GET scope actions:
    1.i get the users data and hes DB records  
    2.mongodbconstructor class - checking if the user exists and if not it will create
       new basic record for the user without the graph data(because if the user
       not exists he never created a graph before)
    3.if there is a data of the specific user so the data will be parsed to the 
       GraphRepresantation that returns a graph html to the dashboard page
    
    POST scope actions:
    here we have a delete button,add graph button and edit button.
    the users input is validated and parsed to the mongodbconstructor methods that handle 
    the CRUD operations and updates the DB data.
    after the data is updated the page refreshed so in the get scope the new data is represented.

    also there is a mongodbconstructor method that checking if the user is exists 
    and validates it.
