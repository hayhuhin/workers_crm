questions:
1.how the user is going to use the crm?
2.



self thinking-
as user logging he will recieve a rank number that defined when registering the user 
the rank number is a priority number that gives the crm a way to know which information the user have permission to see.

the chunks of html will be displayed with the 


query_class
class that will get all the detailes to make a query to the database and get the data 
that needed to be desplayed in the graph with the rank identification(security reasons)

called once inside every page
and calculate and generate output to the plotly method to be used for the graph presentation

args:username,rank,position,leads
method-security(checks that the args are not malicious and the get method is clean)


method-get_daily_data


method-get_weakly_data


method-get_monthly_data


method-get_yearly_data





tasks todo list
merge the personal tasks and the job tasks

add leads on the same page
-add "add button and delete for tasks and leads"
